# Reflection

Back in April of 2019 I made a post about my plans for the year and said I would try to remember to follow up in January. Better late the never I suppose.

## Job

I got a job! During the summer of 2019 I interned at [Coil](https://coil.com/) and was converted full-time. Despite the issues I've had with Make School I feel that they had prepared me for the job. I was never taught React, GraphQL, or TypeScript but those are the main things I have been working with the most there.

## Project

I deployed Cohesion with Sal, but AFAIK it never got a userbase. I'm happy with it though, but I have [some things](#cohesion) I want to do with it

## Learn

### Languages

I didn't end up learning any new languages. I've feeling that NodeJS might be a bit overhyped and I'm starting to believe that the more ridgid, compiled, and staticlly-typed languages are a better fit for the backend.

Because of that I'm much more interested in learning Go or Rust.

## Frontend Frameworks

I didn't touch Angular or Vue, but I did mess around with Svelte. I'm far less interested in learning Angular than Vue.

I like how Svelte is designed and am greatly interested in seeing how it is received. I do think that its value binding might end up being greatly overused. I want to expirement a bit more with Svelte this year.

As I mentioned previously while at Coil I ended up learning GraphQl. I think that all public APIs should have a GraphQL variant. GraphQL's type safety, deep querying, and self-documenting nature cannot be understated. Along with the standard's community I feel that GraphQL will be increasingly more used.

I haven't learned Elasticsearch, WebRTC, or Kubernetes unfortunately. I'm still interested in learning Elasticsearch. I think that OAuth is going to be used increasingly more often and think it would be very worth it to learn.

# 2020

I'm happy with my position at Coil, but as a Software Engineer you gotta keep moving.

## Cohesion

Cohesion ([GitHub](https://github.com/dacioromero/cohesion), [live](https://cohesion.dacio.app/)) is a project I worked on at Make School with my old roommate [Sal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvadorbecerra/). We were both pretty proud of it, but looking back it's quite the mess of spaghetti code. I want to rewrite it to use TypeScript, GraphQL, and Apollo while keeping the styling that Sal worked so hard on.

There's a lot of code to rearranage because there are a lot of patterns that I dislike. I want to make it follow the patterns that I've developed while at Coil.

## ???

I'm not sure what the name of it will be, but I find it easiest to learn while working on something. The baseline stack I want to use is a Rust, SQL (MySQL or Postgres) backend and a React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Apollo frontend and have them communicate with GraphQL. Hopefully I can try to include some OAuth or Elasticsearch in there.
