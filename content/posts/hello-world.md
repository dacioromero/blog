This is my first post made with Jekyll and hopefully the start of a breat blog!

### The Plan

I plan to write about the latest technologies that I've been working on as well as useful tips.

### Where I'm At

I can program in with Python, JavaScript, C#, and Java.

Right now I make websites using React and NodeJS.

I'm pretty comfortable with Docker and GitLab CI.

  - a userbase

    - Go
    - SQL
  - these frontend frameworks
    - Angular

  - GraphQL
  - Elastisearch
